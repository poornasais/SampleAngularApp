<p>Design patterns represent the best practices used by experienced object-oriented software developers. Design patterns
  are solutions to general problems that software developers faced during software development. These solutions were
  obtained by trial and error by numerous software developers over quite a substantial period of time.

  This tutorial will take you through step by step approach and examples using Java while learning Design Pattern
  concepts.</p>

<p>Design Patterns have two main usages in software development.

  Common platform for developers

  Design patterns provide a standard terminology and are specific to particular scenario. For example, a singleton
  design pattern signifies use of single object so all developers familiar with single design pattern will make use of
  single object and they can tell each other that program is following a singleton pattern.

  Best Practices

  Design patterns have been evolved over a long period of time and they provide best solutions to certain problems faced
  during software development. Learning these patterns helps unexperienced developers to learn software design in an
  easy and faster way.</p>
<p>We have considered a business case of fast-food restaurant where a typical meal could be a burger and a cold drink.
  Burger could be either a Veg Burger or Chicken Burger and will be packed by a wrapper. Cold drink could be either a
  coke or pepsi and will be packed in a bottle.

  We are going to create an Item interface representing food items such as burgers and cold drinks and concrete classes
  implementing the Item interface and a Packing interface representing packaging of food items and concrete classes
  implementing the Packing interface as burger would be packed in wrapper and cold drink would be packed as bottle.

  We then create a Meal class having ArrayList of Item and a MealBuilder to build different types of Meal objects by
  combining Item. BuilderPatternDemo, our demo class will use MealBuilder to build a Meal.</p>
